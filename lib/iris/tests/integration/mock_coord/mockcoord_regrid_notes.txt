    # *** Linear ***
    # Linear.regridder --> i.a._regrid.RectilinearRegridder
    #   --> i.a._interpolation.snapshot_grid -->  i.a._interpolation.get_xy_dim_coords
    # So it can't work over AuxCoords.

    # *** Nearest ***
    # Nearest.regridder --> i.a._regrid.RectilinearRegridder
    # So, just like the above : can only use DimCoords.

    # *** AreaWeighted ***
    # ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS : can't use AuxCoords.

    # *** UnstructuredNearest ***
    # This permits the X and Y source-cube coords to be aux-coords
    # It can function when one is a MockCoord -- but the result has none of course (replaced by target coords)
    # Meanwhile... the *target* grid can't have a MockCoord, because it again insists on DimCoords.
