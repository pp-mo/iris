* The ability to pass file format object lists into the rules based load pipeline, as used for GRIB, Fields Files and PP has been added.  The :func:`iris.fileformats.pp.as_cubes` and :func:`iris.fileformats.rules.as_cubes` are provided to produce cubes from such lists.  These lists may have been filtered or altered using the :mod:`iris.fileformats` modules.
