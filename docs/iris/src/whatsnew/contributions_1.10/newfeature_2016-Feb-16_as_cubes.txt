* The ability to pass file format object lists into the rules based load pipeline, as used for GRIB, Fields Files and PP has been added.  The :func:`iris.fileformats.pp.load_pairs_from_fields` and :func:`iris.fileformats.grib.load_pairs_from_fields` are provided to produce cubes from such lists.  These lists may have been filtered or altered using the appropriate :mod:`iris.fileformats` modules.
